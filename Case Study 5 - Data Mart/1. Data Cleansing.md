### CLEANSING STEPS

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

Convert the week_date to a DATE format

Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column

Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
segment	demographic
C	Couples
F	Families
Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns

Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record


~~~~sql
create table clean_weekly_sales
( with date_cte as 
	(select *,
	str_to_date(week_date, '%d/%m/%y') as formatted_date
    from weekly_sales) 
select formatted_date as week_date,
extract(week from formatted_date) as week_number,
extract(month from formatted_date) as month_number,
extract(year from formatted_date) as calendar_year,

segment,
case
 when right(segment, 1) = '1' then 'Young Adults'
 when right(segment, 1) = '2' then 'Middle Aged'
 when right(segment, 1) in ('3', '4') then 'Retirees'
else 'unknown'
end as age_band,

case
when left(segment, 1) = 'C' then 'Couple'
when left(segment, 1) = 'F' then 'Families'
else 'unknown'
end as demographic,

round(sales/transactions, 2) as avg_tranasactions,
region, platform, customer_type, sales, transactions
from date_cte);
