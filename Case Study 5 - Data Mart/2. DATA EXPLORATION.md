#### 10. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
We cannot use average to calculate another aveage. The other way is:
~~~~sql
select calendar_year, platform,
round(sum(sales)/sum(transactions), 2) as avg_transaction
from clean_weekly_sales
group by 1, 2;
~~~~

Answer
| year | demographic | avg_transaction |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 2020 | Retail      | 36.56           |
| 2020 | Shopify     | 179.03          |
| 2019 | Retail      | 36.83           |
| 2019 | Shopify     | 183.36          |
| 2018 | Retail      | 36.56           |
| 2018 | Shopify     | 192.48          |
